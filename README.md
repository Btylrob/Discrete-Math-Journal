# Discrete Math Journal 

This is my discrete math journal / notes from my own personal learning and all content is original. My main goal with this project is to give everyone access to college level Discrete Mathmatics through my notes which take inspiration from but not plagarize books in the subject such as _Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, Eight Edition_ and _Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction_. Whether you are super experienced and want to touch up on your knowledge or are brand new on the subject feel free to read from these notes. All notes are created in markdown to enhance user clarity as my handwriting is really bad. Feel free to contribute to this project as I am not perfect and tend to make mistakes along the way. If you want to add sections which you might find benefit the user or want to make translations to another subject it would be highly appreciated as my main belief is that education should be accesible to everyone.
