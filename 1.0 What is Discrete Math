<p><strong>What is Discrete Mathematics?</strong> Math structures that are countable or otherwise distinct and separable.<br>
<strong>Ex.</strong> The output number 1.232419 is not discrete because the elements are separate.</p>
<p><strong>Four Main Discrete Math Topics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Combinators</strong>, (the theory of ways things combine; in particular how to count these ways)</li>
<li><strong>Sequences</strong></li>
<li><strong>Symbolic Logic</strong></li>
<li><strong>Graph Theory</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="basic-building-blocks-of-mathematical-statements">Basic Building Blocks of Mathematical Statements</h2>
<p><strong>Statement:</strong> Any declarative sentence which is true or false.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Atomic Statements:</strong> One which can not be divided into multiples pieces.<br>
<strong>Ex.</strong> The dog ran.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Molecular Statements:</strong> One which can be divided into multiple pieces.<br>
<strong>Ex.</strong> <mark>The dog ran</mark> and <mark>the cat hid.</mark><br>
Molecular Statements are built using <strong>logical connectives</strong>.<br>
Common logical connectives include but not limited: and, or, if and only if (IFF), not, implies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples-of-atomic-and-molecular-statements">Examples of Atomic and Molecular Statements</h2>
<p><strong>Atomic Statements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Telephone numbers in the United States have 10 digits.<br>
<strong>True</strong>, All telephone numbers in the United States have 10 digits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The moon is made of cheese.<br>
<strong>False</strong>, It is obvious that the moon is not made of cheese.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>42 is a perfect square.<br>
<strong>True</strong>, The number 42 is a perfect square.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOT Atomic Statements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>3 + x = 12<br>
<strong>NOT Molecular</strong>, There is more than one answer to this could be 9 or 3<sup>2</sup>…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would you like some cake?<br>
<strong>NOT Molecular</strong>, There could be more than one answer to this.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Molecular Statements:</strong><br>
3. <mark>Telephone numbers in the United States have 10 digits</mark> and <mark>42 is a perfect square</mark>.<br>
<strong>Molecular</strong> “and” is the identified logical connective, and both statements are true.</p>
